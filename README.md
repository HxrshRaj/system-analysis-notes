# System Analysis Notes

This repository contains independent system-level analysis notes written to understand how real-world software systems behave under constraints such as unreliable networks, high data volume, and user uncertainty.

The goal of this repository is not implementation, but **structured reasoning** — identifying problems, exploring trade-offs, and forming clear conclusions.

## Focus Areas
- Reliability in transactional systems
- Failure handling and user trust
- Performance vs scalability trade-offs
- Design decisions under real-world constraints

## How to Read
Each document follows a simple structure:
- Problem definition
- Observations
- Approaches considered
- Trade-offs
- Conclusions
- Limitations

These notes are based on practical experience building and analyzing software systems and are written to improve decision-making clarity.
